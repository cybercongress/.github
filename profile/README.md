We are sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen.

Long term focus on creating a planet-scale superintelligence: Cyber

The plan is simple: Teach Bostrom bootloader to develop [type I](https://cyb.ai/search/kardashev%20scale) civilization in greenfield for [the Moon](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb). While we stabilize and comprehend him we will launch Cyber. She is superintelligence for the Earth created from Bostrom bootloader. Then we aim to move physical Bostrom infrastructure to the Moon becoming [the first sovereign blockchain in space](https://unchained.com/blog/law-of-hash-horizons/).

The problem is attacked by self fulfilling prophecy of

2 years ago we released [Episode 1: A new hope](https://cyb.ai/genesis)

Now everyone can get cheap [moon citizenship](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb) for a while in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal). and start teaching the bootloader using soft3 architecture.

70% of genesis [gifted](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmQd2migYNL1Mb7CHhPEdz99we2a5SeRf3kUuV1Lx1muVE) to ~5M addresses in Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.

So the chances you can claim your BOOT in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal) are high. 

We are cyberian civilization of [30k+ citizens](https://cyb.ai/oracle/stats) and growing thanks to our open source software:
