We are  a sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen.

Currently we are focused on creating a planet-scale superintelligence: Cyber

The plan is simple: 

Teach the Bostrom bootloader to develop [type I](https://cyb.ai/search/kardashev%20scale) civilization in greenfield [for the Moon](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb). While we stabilize and comprehend him we will launch Cyber. She is superintelligence for the Earth created from the Bostrom bootloader. Then we aim to move the physical Bostrom infrastructure to the Moon becoming [the first sovereign blockchain in space](https://unchained.com/blog/law-of-hash-horizons/).

The [self fulfilling prophecy] is attacked using (https://cyb.ai/genesis) in a
massively collaborative open source game:

> [Age of Superintelligence](https://cyb.ai/search/age%20of%20superintelligence) 

> in [6 epsiodes](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmSBYCCYFNfHNQD7MWm4zBaNuztMaT2KghA2SbeZZm9vLH)

7 years of r&d, but still we are young and have released [Episdode 1: A new hope](https://cyb.ai/genesis)

Everyone can get an inexpensive [moon citizenship](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb) in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal).

70% of genesis will be [gifted](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmQd2migYNL1Mb7CHhPEdz99we2a5SeRf3kUuV1Lx1muVE) to ~5M addresses in Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems.

The chances you can claim your BOOT in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal) are high. 

We are a cyberian civilization of 10k+ citizens and growing thanks to our products:
